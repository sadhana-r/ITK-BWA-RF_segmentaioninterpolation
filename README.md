FACILITATING MANUAL SEGMENTATION OF 3D DATASETS USING CONTOUR ANDINTENSITY GUIDED INTERPOLATION

Manual segmentation of anatomical structures in 3D imaging datasets is a highly time-consuming process. This process can be sped up using interslice interpolation techniques, which require only a small subset of slices to be manually segmented. 
We propose a two-step interpolation approach that utilizes a ``binary weighted averaging" algorithm to interpolate contour information, and the random forest framework to perform intensity-based label classification.
